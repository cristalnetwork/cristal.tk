September was extra busy over at the Stoplight HQ!

## New Stoplight Documentation

At long last, we have taken the time to update our own documentation. You can find ~30 new articles over at [https://help.stoplight.io](https://help.stoplight.io). Our new help portal covers the Stoplight platform, our new API, and the Prism runtime. We have an additional ~20 articles lined up for October.

Oh, and it’s powered by Stoplight! We are introducing a new hosted documentation product this October — the portal tier. It will be priced at $199, and allows you to connect many published docs into one portal, with advanced search and other great features.

Limited time offer — If you want a help portal like [https://help.stoplight.io](https://help.stoplight.io), shoot us an email at [support@stoplight.io](mailto:support@stoplight.io) and we will assign a dedicated engineer to set it up for you, and make it perfect.

## New Stoplight API

One of the most requested features has been the ability to programmatically get OAS / Swagger / RAML into, and out of, Stoplight. Today, we are releasing the Stoplight public API, which makes it easy to connect your existing processes to the Stoplight platform. Read more about it in [our API docs](https://help.stoplight.io/api-v1).

## RAML 1.0

Second most requested feature — RAML 1.0 support has landed! Take advantage of the latest and greatest, and import / export RAML 1.0 directly from the Stoplight app.

## 5x Faster API Docs + Mocking

We understand speed is important, so we’ve been working hard to make API docs as fast as possible. We revised the entire API docs architecture, and now it is almost completely static (no server involved), and loads lickety split. Just check out the [Giphy API Docs](https://giphy.api-docs.io). We will be describing this new architecture in more detail in October on our blog. Also, optionally allow your docs readers to send test requests to a mock version of your API.
