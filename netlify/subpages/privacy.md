Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  **"Cookies"** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the Site.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services.
